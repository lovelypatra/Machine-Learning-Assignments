    "# 1. What is prior probability ? Give an example ?\n",
    "Ans: Prior probability shows the likelihood of an outcome in a given dataset. For example, in the mortgage case, P(Y) is the default rate on a home mortgage, which is 2%. P(Y|X) is called the conditional probability, which provides the probability of an outcome given the evidence, that is, when the value of X is known.\n"

    "Ans: Naive Bayes is a simple and powerful algorithm for predictive modeling. Naive Bayes is called naive because it assumes that each input variable is independent. This is a strong assumption and unrealistic for real data; however, the technique is very effective on a large range of complex problems.\n"

With the training set, we can train a Naive Bayes classifier which we can use to automaticall categorize a new sentence.\n",

    "Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.\n",
