    "# 1. What exactly is a feature? Give an example to illustrate your point ?\n",
    "Ans: Features are the basic building blocks of datasets. The quality of the features in your dataset has a major impact on the quality of the insights you will gain when you use that dataset for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, different business problems within the same industry do not necessarily require the same features, which is why it is important to have a strong understanding of the business goals of your data science project.\n"

    "Ans: The features in your data will directly influence the predictive models you use and the results you can achieve. Your results are dependent on many inter-dependent properties. You need great features that describe the structures inherent in your data. Better features means flexibility.\n"

    "Ans: Converting categorical features into numeric features using domain knowledge. For example, we are given a list of countries and say we know the distance to these countries from India then we can replace it with distance from India. So, every country can be represented as its distance from India.\n"

    "Ans: Wrapper methods measure the “usefulness” of features based on the classifier performance. In contrast, the filter methods pick up the intrinsic properties of the features (i.e., the “relevance” of the features) measured via univariate statistics instead of cross-validation performance.\n",

    "Ans: Feature selection is for filtering irrelevant or redundant features from your dataset. The key difference between feature selection and extraction is that feature selection keeps a subset of the original features while feature extraction creates brand new ones."
